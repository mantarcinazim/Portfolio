          <p style="color: aliceblue;"> From Vouvry, take the direction of Miex (8km) to the Flon car park. The road between Flon and Taney is closed to traffic. 

            If the Flon car park is full, follow the instructions of the on-site parking agents. Depending  you need to leave your vehicle, your walking time may double before you get to Taney. We advise you to take public transport from Vouvry to the Flon car park.</p>

          <p style="color: aliceblue;"> If there's one thing I missed in Vienna, it's the mountains. There was no shortage of it! Just back in my native Valais, after an evening a little drunk a friend comes to pick me up early in the morning with the objective of the Grammont and its magnificent view of Lake Geneva. A walk not too difficult but that climbs well ... Perfect to get the machine running again! </p>

          <p style="color: aliceblue;"> Built on the alluvial range of the Morge border stream, the town is a real link between the two countries, as well as between Valais and Haute-Savoie. Accessible by car, train or boat, St-Gingolph offers some beautiful historic sites, impressive wood-panelled reception halls and 17th-century chapel. The museum is dedicated to shipbuilding and its traditions. </p>

        <mark>ABOUT US</mark>    <br>Hello to you, dear visitor, The building commission is, among other things, a body for consulting applications submitted to the municipality for construction, transformation or renovation of buildings located in building zones. It is made up of several competent and complementary members to study the files presented in their regulatory, aesthetic and legal form, as well as at the level of safety, while ensuring their integration into the built landscape of our village.Aware of the legislation in force and the administrative constraints related to this work, we strive to be a support for applicants, in order to give the maximum chance of succeeding in their request, taking into account the municipal, cantonal or even federal legal basis.
